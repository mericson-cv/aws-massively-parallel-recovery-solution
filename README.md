# Commvault Backup & Recovery - Massively Parallel Recovery Solution

Example Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deploy on-demand and Spot Amazon EC2 instances to perform a massively parallel recovery using [Commvault Backup & Recovery](https://www.commvault.com/platform/products/backup-and-recovery).

## :books: Background

[Commvault Backup & Recovery](https://www.commvault.com/aws) is the industry leading data protection and cyber-resilience solution for protecting AWS services, SaaS, and other hybrid workloads. You can use Commvault Backup & Recovery to secure, defend, and recover your business applications and data (learn more at [www.commvault.com](https://www.commvault.com).

This example solution show-cases the elasticity of Amazon EC2, the scalability of Amazon S3, and the power of the Commvault Backup & Recovery data platform to achieve a massivelly parallel restore with on-demand ephemeral resources deployed using Infrastructure as Code.

A part of any modern data management plan includes an understanding of your business _recovery time objectives_ and in extreme circumstances (i.e., where multiple applications are affected), the elastic nature of AWS compute allows a rapid and **cost effective** rapid recovery solution for many systems in parallel.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup

At a high-level the process for setup and execution this solution (depicted above) is as follows:
1. Deploy [Commvault Backup & Recovery BYOL](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ecysdywnipxv6?sr=0-3&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) from the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=88cecb14-a8b2-49bd-ba1f-58be76108f48) using AWS CloudFormation.
2. Review the ```CommvaultBackupAndRecovery``` AWS IAM role and policies that allow Commavult to backup and recovery your AWS workloads.
3. Complete the [Core Setup Wizard](https://documentation.commvault.com/2023e/essential/86625_quick_start_guide.html#step-3-complete-core-setup-wizard) and run a backup of your EC2 instances and/or other [supported workloads](https://www.commvault.com/supported-technologies/amazon/aws) to Amazon S3.
4. Deploy 100 x [Commvault Cloud Access Node ARM BYOL](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-usqf7gn3ipqke?sr=0-2&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) with [CloudFormation template](https://github.com/mericson-cv/aws-massively-parallel-recovery-solution/tree/main/cloudformation) and configure.
5. Run a massively parallel restore.

:bulb: Tip: There are HashiCorp Terraform examples in the [terraform folder](https://github.com/mericson-cv/aws-massively-parallel-recovery-solution/tree/main/terraform) to quickly deploy on-demand or [Amazon EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/), complete with _random data_ generation on first boot. 

_100 instances are used only as an example to demonstrate the massively parallel nature of __Commvault Backup & Recovery__, Amazon S3, and Amazon EC2 compute. Commvault recommends performing regular testing and [GameDays](https://aws.amazon.com/gameday/) in your IT, Security, and Application teams to find the right mix of recovery speed (throughput) and overall recovery cost_. 

The key **benefit** of this solution is that the recovery resources are __ephemeral__ and may be destroyed immediately after the restore is complete.

üí≤Note: The [Commvault Backup & Recovery BYOL](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ecysdywnipxv6?sr=0-3&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) product comes with a free 30-day trial so you can try this out yourself. You will incur additional costs for the AWS services you utilize during your test. Consult the AWS pricing pages for more details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup - Step 1 - Deploy Commvault Backup & Recovery from the AWS Marketplace

This step deploys Commvault Backup & Recovery as a single Amazon EC2 instance running Microsoft Windows. If you already have a Commvault Backup & Recovery deployment, you may skip this step.

1. Login to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) as a user that can deploy new Amazon EC2, Amazon S3. and AWS IAM resources using Amazon CloudFormation.
2. Open new browser tab to [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) and search for ```Commvault```.
3. Click [Commvault Backup & Recovery BYOL](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ecysdywnipxv6?sr=0-3&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa).
4. Select **CloudFormation Template** Fulfilment Option and supply requested information.
6. Select the **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.** checkbox.
7. Click **Submit** to deploy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup - Step 2 - Review the created AWS IAM role and policies that allow Commavult to backup and recovery your AWS workloads.

Commvault will create a single AWS IAM Role called `CommvaultBackupAndRecovery`.

Detailed information of the AWS IAM Policies required by Commvault (per AWS workload) may be viewed [here](https://documentation.commvault.com/2023e/essential/101442_requirements_and_usage_for_aws_iam_policies_and_permissions.html#iam-policies).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup - Step 3 - Complete the Core Setup Wizard and run a backup.

### Creating a Commvault admin account
1. Obtain your ```Administrator``` password for your newly created ```Commvault Backup & Recovery``` instance.
2. Login using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
3. Wait for the ```******* Starting Commserve image customization ********``` powershell first-boot configuration script to complete. 

:bulb: **Tip**: Commvault recommends using [Amazon EC2 Instance Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-ec2-instance-connect-ssh-rdp-public-ip-address/) for secure access to your Commvault instance _without_ the need to expose public IP addresses, or manage __bastion hosts__.

üí° **Tip**: *Be patient*, remember that each of the Amazon EBS volumes on the host is being provisioned from Amazon EBS snapshots that are stored in Amazon S3.

A browser will open to complete the remaining setup.

4.	Provide the **Email address** that will be associated with the Commvault ```admin``` user ([break glass account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/break-glass-access.html)).
5.	Provide the **Password** that will be associated with the Commvault ```admin``` user.
6.	Click **Create account**.
7.	You will be greeted with Command Center login screen. Login with newly created ```admin``` user and password.
8.	Click **OK** to accept the License and Registration warning.

:warning: Warning: If you are using a trial license the ```Cloud Storage``` license will be constrained to a maximum of ten (10) concurrent MediaAgents during the restore. If you have a paid Commvault license, you can [submit a request](https://ma.commvault.com/Support/ProductRegistration) to extend your ```Cloud Storage``` license to match your required parallism (i.e., the total number of Access Nodes you will have active in your Commvault environment).

### Completing Commvault Core Setup
Next, you just need to tell Commvault how often you want to run backups, and where to store your backups (i.e., Amazon S3).

1. Click **Let‚Äôs get started**.
2. Click **Cloud** in the Add storage page.
3. Provide a **Cloud library Name** (i.e., ```Amazon S3-IA - Backups us-east-1```).
4. Select **Amazon S3** as the Cloud storage Type.
5. Set the **Service host** to ```s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com``` (your Region may differ).
6. Select **IAM role** for the credentials.
7. Enter the ```**bucket name**``` created during your AWS CloudFormation deployment.

üí° Hint: You can find the bucket name in the AWS CloudFormation Console, in your stack, on the Outputs tab, as CvltCloudLibraryBucketName

9. Leave **Storage class**, as the default S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA).
10. Enter the **Deduplication DB location**, use the volume pre-setup, pre-formatted with correct block-size (i.e., ```H:\Amqzon-S3-IA-DDB```)
11. Click **Save** to accept defaults for your server plan.

Consider [upgrading your Commvault software](https://documentation.commvault.com/2023e/essential/120686_downloading_software_on_demand.html) to the latest Maintenance Release before moving to the next step.

### Deploying some test Amazon EC2 instances
If you are simply testing this solution, navigate to the [terraform](https://github.com/mericson-cv/aws-massively-parallel-recovery-solution/blob/main/terraform/100-amazon-ec2-instances%20(10GB%20random%20data)/main.tf) file where you can find an example to deploy one hundred (100) on-demand Amazon EC2 test hosts.

### Run an initial backup
You will need an initial backup of your protected workloads before you can run a massively parallel restore. Assuming you used the terraform example above, perform the following to configure and run a backup.
1. [Add your AWS account](https://documentation.commvault.com/2023e/essential/121660_configuring_backups_for_amazon_ec2_instances.html#add-hypervisor) to Commvault Backup & Recovery.
2. Create an [Amazon EC2 group](https://documentation.commvault.com/2023e/essential/121660_configuring_backups_for_amazon_ec2_instances.html#add-vm-group) to auto-discover EC2 instances and protect them.
3. Run a **[backup](https://documentation.commvault.com/2023e/essential/121676_backing_up_amazon_ec2_instances_on_demand.html)**

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup - Step 4 - Deploy 100 x Cloud Access Nodes and configure
OK, it's time to setup your set of parallel **Cloud Access Nodes**, Commvault uses Cloud Access Nodes to perform backup, replication, restores. Commvault recommends [AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) based Access Nodes for best price-performance and so you can meet your [Shared Sustainabiltiy Responsibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/the-shared-responsibility-model.html) in AWS. 

You can acclerate recovery time by increasing the number of Access Nodes used, allowing more parallel recovery activities to run at the same time. Not only does this increase business agility, it also saves cost as you are only paying for what you use (_during the restore_).

1. Navigate to **Manage > CommCell** and enable **Requires authcode for installation** toggle.
2. Click the **authcode** and save it somewhere safe, you will need it next.
3. Download the 100 x Amazon EC2 Cloud Access Nodes [```template.yml```](https://github.com/mericson-cv/aws-massively-parallel-recovery-solution/tree/main/cloudformation/100x%20Cloud%20Access%20Nodes) and update to match your environment. You will find instructions at the top of the template for performing updates

```
#
# INSTRUCTIONS: 
# - Ensure AWS Account where instances are deployed has an AWS IAM role called 'CommvaultBackupAndRecovery' (this role is created during deployment of the 'Commvault Backup & Recovery BYOL' product in AWS Marketplace).
# - Update all occurrences of the KeyName parameter to a Key pair Name in your AWS account.
# - Update all occurrences of the SubnetId parameter with the Subnet ID that your 'Commvault Backup & Recovery' instance resides within - this allows use of Commvault HotAdd recovery
# - Update all occurrences of the GroupSet parameter with a Security group ID that allows incoming TCP (8400, 8403) and ICMP (PING) from the 'Commbvault Backup & Recovery' instance.
# - Optionally update the ImageId, InstanceType
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS to auto-register instances with your Commvault Backup & Recovery instance
# - Replace all occurrences of the -CSHost parameter (see UserData section) to include the IPv4 address of your 'Commvault Backup & Recovery' instance.
# - Replace all occurrences of the -CSName parameter (see UserData section) to match the fully-qualified hostname returned by `nslookup <YOUR-CS-HOST>` (or your CommServe friendly name as shown in Commvault Command Center home screen).
# - Obtain the authcode for your CommServe and replace all occurrences of -authcode parameter (see UserData section).
#
```
4. Create and launch a new AWS CloudFormation Stack with your customized ```template.yml``` using either the [console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-using-console.html) or the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-using-cli.html).
5. Navigate to **Manage > Server groups** and click **Add server group**
6. Provide a freeform text **Name** for your group. This group will contain all of the Access Nodes you just deployed using CloudFormation.
7. Select **automatic association** and add a rule with the following settings, then click **Save**
```
Client Scope - Clients in this CommCell
Rule: Package Installed == Virtual Server
Rule: OS Version contains 'Amazon Linux'
Rule: Power State == ON
```
9. Navigate to your previously configured [Amazon EC2 group](https://documentation.commvault.com/2023e/essential/159097_updating_amazon_ec2_vm_group.html) and add your **group** for the access nodes
10. Add a new entity-based additional setting called ```nStartAgentThreads``` and set to ```100```.
11. Add a new entity-based additional setting called ```MaxRestoreStreams``` and set to ``100``.
12. Open **Commvault CommCell Console** and noativate to the Cloud library where your backups are stored, expand the libarry right-click **Mount-Path**.
13. Select **Share Mount Path**
14. Click the **Share** button and add each new Access Node with an _Access Mode_ of ```Read```
15. Click **Save**
