# Commvault Backup & Recovery - Massively Parallel Recovery Solution

Example Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deploy on-demand and Spot Amazon EC2 instances to perform a massively parallel recovery using [Commvault Backup & Recovery](https://www.commvault.com/platform/products/backup-and-recovery).

## :books: Background

[Commvault Backup & Recovery](https://www.commvault.com/aws) is the industry leading data protection and cyber-resilience solution for protecting AWS services, SaaS, and other hybrid workloads. You can use Commvault Backup & Recovery to secure, defend, and recover your business applications and data (learn more at [www.commvault.com](https://www.commvault.com).

This example solution show-cases the elasticity of Amazon EC2, the scalability of Amazon S3, and the power of the Commvault Backup & Recovery data platform to achieve a massivelly parallel restore with on-demand ephemeral resources deployed using Infrastructure as Code.

A part of any modern data management plan includes an understanding of your business _recovery time objectives_ and in extreme circumstances (i.e., where multiple applications are affected), the elastic nature of AWS compute allows a rapid and **cost effective** rapid recovery solution for many systems in parallel.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup

At a high-level the process for setup and execution this solution (depicted above) is as follows:
1. Deploy [Commvault Backup & Recovery BYOL](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ecysdywnipxv6?sr=0-3&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) from the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=88cecb14-a8b2-49bd-ba1f-58be76108f48) using AWS CloudFormation.
2. Review the AWS IAM policies and role ```CommvaultBackupAndRecovery``` that was created to allow access to AWS workloads to protect.
3. Complete the initial [Core Setup Wizard](https://documentation.commvault.com/2023e/essential/86625_quick_start_guide.html#step-3-complete-core-setup-wizard) and run a backup of your EC2 instances and/or other [supported workloads](https://www.commvault.com/supported-technologies/amazon/aws) to an Amazon S3 frequent access storage class.
4. Deploy 100 x [Commvault Cloud Access Node ARM BYOL](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-usqf7gn3ipqke?sr=0-2&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) using Amazon CloudFormation and configure additional settings to permit massively parallel scheduling of recovery across the 100 Access Nodes.
5. Run a massively parallel restore.

:bulb: Tip: There are HashiCorp Terraform examples in the [terraform folder](https://github.com/mericson-cv/aws-massively-parallel-recovery-solution/tree/main/terraform) to quickly deploy on-demand or [Amazon EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/), complete with random data generation on first boot.

_100 instances here are used as an example only to demonstrate the massively parallel nature of __Commvault Backup & Recovery__, Amazon S3, and Amazon EC2 compute. Commvault recommends performing regular testing and GameDays in your IT, Security, and Application teams to find the right mix of recovery speed (throughput) and recovery cost_

üí≤Note: The [Commvault Backup & Recovery BYOL](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ecysdywnipxv6?sr=0-3&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) product comes with a free 30-day trial so you can try this out yourself. You will incur additional costs for the AWS services you utilize during your test. Consult the AWS pricing pages for more details.

## „äôÔ∏è Setup - Step 2 - Deploy Commvault AWS IAM policies and role

This step is completed as part of Step 1.

Commvault will create a single AWS IAM Role called `CommvaultBackupAndRecovery`.

Detailed information of the AWS IAM Policies required by Commvault (per AWS workload) may be viewed [here](https://documentation.commvault.com/2023e/essential/101442_requirements_and_usage_for_aws_iam_policies_and_permissions.html#iam-policies).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup - Step 3 - Perform initial one-time setup

### Creating a Commvault admin account
1. Obtain your ```Administrator``` password for your newly created ```Commvault Backup & Recovery``` instance.
2. Login using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - Commvault recommends using [Amazon EC2 Instance Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-ec2-instance-connect-ssh-rdp-public-ip-address/) for secure access to your Commvault instance _without_ the need to expose public IP addresses, or manage __bastion hosts___.
3. Wait for the ******* Starting Commserve image customization ******** powershell bootstrapper script to complete.
   
(this script runs only once, at first boot to configure the Commserve name)
(you can get a complete log of the bootstrapper activity in E:\Program Files\Commvault\ContentStore\Log Files\CS_Customization.log)

üí°Tip: **Be patient**, remember that each of the Amazon EBS volumes on the host is likely lazy-loading from Amazon S3, as they have just been created from Amazon EBS snapshots.

A browser will open when complete advanced, proceed to localhost (unsafe)
[https://localhost/adminconsole](https://localhost/adminconsole)

4.	Provide the **Email address(( that will be associated with the Commvault ‚Äòadmin‚Äô built-in account ([break glass account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/break-glass-access.html)).
5.	Provide the **Password** that will be associated with the Commvault ‚Äòadmin‚Äô built-in account.
6.	Click **Create account** button
7.	You will be greeted with Command Center login screen. Login with newly provide admin and password.
8.	Click **OK** to accept the License and Registration warning.

:warning: Warning: If you are using a trial license the ```Cloud Storage``` license will be constrained to a maximum of ten (10) concurrent MediaAgents during the restore. If you have a paid Commvault license, you can [submit a request](https://ma.commvault.com/Support/ProductRegistration) to extend your ```Cloud Storage``` license to match your required parallism (i.e., the total number of MediaAGents you will have active in your Commvault environment).

### Completing Commvault Core Setup
