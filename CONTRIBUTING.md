# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new example, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Report Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/mericson-cv/aws-massively-parallel-recovery-solution/issues) to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps.
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug.
* A description of your environment or deployment.

## Contribute via Pull Requests (PRs)

Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

* You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
* You check the existing open and recently merged pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't already addressed the problem.
* You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.
